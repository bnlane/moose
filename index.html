        <p>Moose have short tails, a hump on their shoulders and large ears that can rotate to give them stereophonic hearing. Their fur is generally brown or black and provides excellent insulation from the cold. Male moose, called bulls, have massive antlers. These can grow 6 feet (1.8 m)wide from tip to tip. Antlers are only used for fighting for a mate, and they are shed each winter after mating season, which runs from September to October. Moose are the largest members of the deer family. Males are heavier than females; males weigh 794 to 1,323 pounds, while females weigh 595 to 882 pounds.</p>

        <p>Moose is a twig eater. This is a good generalization of what moose eat in the wild. They tend to graze on the leaves, bark, pine cones, twigs and buds of trees and shrubs. They also like to eat aquatic plants like water lilies. Moose have four-chambered stomachs, as do cows. They regurgitate partially digested food and “chew their cud” Food is fermented in the first chamber, and nutrients are extracted in the next three. After a gestation period of 231 days, females give birth to one baby, called a calf. 
        <br><br>
        Within their first day of life, calves can stand up on their own. They weigh around 35.7 pounds at birth and grow very quickly, gaining 2.2 lbs.per day while they are nursing. After 6 months, calves are weaned. At 4 to 6 years old they are fully grown, though many never make it to adulthood. Around 50 percent of calves die due to bear or wolf attacks before they are 6 weeks old, according to ADW. Once they are adults, they have a survival rate of up to 95 percent. Surviving moose typically live around 15 to 20 years.
